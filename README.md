# IBM-DAY-4
 📚 Library Management System (Node.js + MongoDB)
This project is a **backend REST API** for managing library books.
It is developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** to perform full **CRUD operations**.

This project is created as part of a **student learning assignment** to understand backend development and database integration.

🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:

* Store library book data in MongoDB
* Perform **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations
* Apply **conditions and validations**
* Test APIs using **Postman**

🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment
* **Express.js** – Web framework for Node.js
* **MongoDB** – NoSQL database
* **Mongoose** – ODM (Object Data Modeling) for MongoDB
* **Postman** – API testing tool

 📄 File-by-File Explanation

🔹 1. `app.js` (Main Server File)

This is the **entry point** of the application.

**Responsibilities:**

* Creates the Express server
* Defines all API routes
* Handles CRUD operations
* Listens on port `3000`

**What happens in this file:**

* Imports Express and Book model
* Uses `express.json()` to read JSON data
* Contains API endpoints for:

  * Adding books
  * Fetching books
  * Updating book details
  * Deleting books with conditions
* Starts the server using `app.listen()`

📌 Without `app.js`, the server cannot run.
🔹 2. `db.js` (Database Connection File)

This file is responsible for **connecting Node.js to MongoDB**.

**Responsibilities:**

* Imports Mongoose
* Connects to MongoDB database `libraryDB`
* Handles successful connection and errors
* Exports the mongoose instance

**Connection URL Used:**

mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/libraryDB

📌 This file ensures the database connection happens **only once** and is reused everywhere.

🔹 3. `bookmodel.js` (Schema & Model File)

This file defines **how book data should look** in the database.

**Responsibilities:**

* Defines Book schema
* Sets field types
* Applies basic validation
* Creates and exports the Book model

**Book Fields:**

| Field Name      | Description                                     |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| title           | Book title                                      |
| author          | Author name                                     |
| category        | Book category                                   |
| publishedYear   | Year of publication                             |
| availableCopies | Number of copies available (cannot be negative) |

📌 This file acts as a **blueprint** for the `books` collection.

 🔹 4. `package.json`

This file contains **project metadata and dependencies**.

**Responsibilities:**

* Stores project name
* Lists required packages
* Helps install dependencies using `npm install`

**Dependencies Used:**

* `express`
* `mongoose`

📌 Without this file, dependencies cannot be managed.

 🔹 5. `package-lock.json`

This file:

* Locks exact dependency versions
* Ensures same setup on every system
* Automatically generated by npm

📌 You should **always push this file** to GitHub.

🗄️ Database Details

* **Database Name:** `libraryDB`
* **Collection Name:** `books`

 Book Schema Fields

| Field Name      | Type   |
| --------------- | ------ |
| title           | String |
| author          | String |
| category        | String |
| publishedYear   | Number |
| availableCopies | Number |

🚀 Features Implemented

 ✅ CREATE

* Adds **minimum 7 predefined books** to the database

 ✅ READ

* Fetch all books
* Fetch books by category
* Fetch books published after 2015

✅ UPDATE

* Increase or decrease available copies
* Prevents negative stock
* Update book category

 ✅ DELETE

* Book can be deleted **only if availableCopies = 0**
 📌 API Endpoints

➕ Add Books


POST /addBooks
 📖 Get All Books
GET /books


### 📂 Get Books by Category


GET /books/category/:category


 📅 Get Books Published After 2015

GET /books/year/after2015
 🔄 Update Available Copies

PUT /books/updateCopies/:id

**Request Body Example:**

json
{
  "change": 2
}


 🏷️ Change Book Category


PUT /books/changeCategory/:id


**Request Body Example:**

json
